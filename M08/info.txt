	Containers in c++

A contaner is a holder object that stores a collection of other obejects (its elements), the are implemented as class templates, which allows great flexibility in the types supported as elements,

the contaner manages the storage space for its elements and provides memeber functions to acess them, either directly or through iterators(reference objects with similar properties to pointers).

	Types of STL (standard template library)
1 => Sequential Containers:
in c++ sequential contaners allow us to store elements that can be accessed in qequential order.
Internally sequential containers are implemented as arrays or linked lists data structures.
 types of sequential containers:
 . Array
 . Vector
need to learn more about this one : how does it works (is it just a linked list or array with realloc)
 . Deque
 . List
 . Forward List

 2 => Associative Containers:
 in c++, associative containers allow us to store elements in sorted the order doesn't depend upon when the element is inserted.
Internally, the are implemented as binary tree data structures.
types of Associative containers:
. Set
. Map
. Multiset
. Multimap
