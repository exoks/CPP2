	Containers in c++

A container is a holder object that stores a collection of other obejects (its elements), the are implemented as class templates, which allows great flexibility in the types supported as elements, (make programming quickly , efficiently and generic)
i
Generic programming: generic-types == templates
 - datas types not specified in implementation, but rather in its use.
 - compile-time polymorphism.

componenets of STL:
- containers : data structures to store collection of objects.
- iterators  : pointers like object that allows traversal of containers.
- algorithms : set of function, to deal with containers (search , sort, merge ...)
- functors (function objects) : classes with overload operators (), so they can be used as functions (<functional> std::plus, equal to)

the container manages the storage space for its elements and provides memeber functions to acess them, either directly or through iterators(reference objects with similar properties to pointers).

	Types of STL (standard template library)
1 => Sequential Containers:
in c++ sequential contaners allow us to store elements that can be accessed in qequential order.
Internally sequential containers are implemented as arrays or linked lists data structures.
 types of sequential containers:
 . Array
 . Vector : dynamic size array, elements are stored continously in memory, random access.
need to learn more about this one : how does it works (is it just a linked list or array with realloc)
 . Deque : double-ended queue pope from both ends (not as normal push from side and poping from the one)
 . List : (simple list) doubly linked list, elements are not stored continously in memory, random access are not supported, insertion and deletion are supported unlike vector.
 . Forward List (single linked list)

THE IDEA IS SIMPLE:

 2 => Associative Containers:
 in c++, associative containers allow us to store elements in sorted the order doesn't depend upon when the element is inserted.
Internally, the are implemented as binary tree data structures.
types of Associative containers:
. Set
. Map
. Multiset
. Multimap

 3 => Container Adapters : interfaces that implement special functionality on top of sequence containers.
 . Stack
 . Queue
 . Priority queue

ITERATORS:
 - An iterator is an object that can iterate over elements in c++ standard library container and provide access to individual elements.
the c++ Standard library containers all provide iterators so that algorithms can access their elements in a standard way without having to be converned with the type of container the elements are stored in.
- you can use iterators explicityly using member and global functions such as begin() and end() and operators such as ++ and -- to move forward or backward, you can also use iterators implicitly with a range-for loop or (for some iterator types) the subscript operator [].

iterators are one of the four pillars of STL in c++, and iterator is used to point the memory address of the stll container classess. for better understanding youn can rlate them with a pointer to some extent.

iterators act as a bridge that connects algorithms to STL containers and allows the modification of the data present inside the container, they allow you to iterate over the containers, access and assign the values, and run different operators over them. to get the desired result.

=> Difference between iterators and Pointers ?
Pointer:
	- pointer is a varibale that stores the memory address of the variable it is pointing to.
	- pointer has a data type. 
	- the pointer help to provide large information to the functions by just passing the mem address of the object.

Iterator:
	- iterators are used to point to the memory address of the STL containers.
	- iterators are used to iterate over the data structures (access or assign value that a pointer as unable to do)
	- pointers can also point to functions, whereas the iterators just serve the purpose of performing operations on the STL containers.

	HOW VECTORS WORKS ?
Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size, and just like arrays vectors use contiguous storage locatinos for their elements, which means that their elements can also be accessed using offsets on regular pointers to its elements, and just as efficiently as in arrays, but unlike arrays their size can change dynamically, with their storage being handled automatically by the container.

Internally, vectors use a dynamically allocated array to store their elements, this array me need to be reallocated in order to grow in size when new elements are inserted, which implies allocation a new array and moving all element to it the is a relatively expensize task in terms of processing tie, and << VECTORS DO NOT REALLOCATE EACH TIME AN ELEMENT IS ADDED TO THE CONTIANER >> instead vector containers may allocate some extra storage to accommodate for possible growth, and the container may have an actual capacity greater than the storage strictly needed to contain its elements, libraries can implement different strategies for grwth to balance between memory usage adn reallocations, but in any case reallocations should only heppen at logarithmically growing intervals of size so that the insertion of individual elelements at the end of the vctor can be provided with AMORTIZED CONST TIME complixty.

Therefore, compared to arrays, vectors consume more memory in exchange for the abbility to manage storage and grow dyanmically in efficient way.

/compared to the other dynamic sequence containers (deques , lists, forward lists), vectors are very efficient accessing its elements (just like arrays) and relatively efficient adding or removing elements from its end, for operations that invlove inserting or removing elements at positions other than the end, they perform worse than the others, and have less consisstent iterators and references that list and forward lists.



< STL ALGORITHM : STL  is nothing but iterators + template + algorithm >
-STL algorithm library defines functions for a variety of purposes (searching, sorting, counting, manipulating).
-Algorithms are applied to range of elements.
-<algorithm> header is used to get all algorithms available in STL.

1|_Sort:

Syntax:
	Sort(iterator begin, iterator end);
	Sort(exec policy, iterator begin, iterator end);
	Sort(iterator begin, iterator end, function object());
	Sort(iterator begin, iterator end, lambda function());
										std::greater<int>();
										std::less<int>();

 - In C++ STL we have sort function that can sort in ascending or decending order.
 - Not only Integer value can be sorted (Integral) and other types can be sorted:
 	+ sorting integer data types
	+ sorting user defined data types (objects) by using overload operator < or >, or function object,
		lambda pression ([](args){body})
 - how sort function is working ? : it uses IntroSort which is combination of quickSort, headpSort and InsertionSor,
 	By default it uses quickSort but
	if quickSort is doing unfair partitioning and taking more than N*LogN time,
	it switches to headSort and when the array size becomes really small, it switches to InsertionSort.
 - We can use parellel execution policy for better performance.
	sort(std::execution::par, v.begin(), v.end()); (Guess, this one create more threads for better performance)

2|_is_sort
	checks if the elements in range [first, last] are sorted in non-descending order.

Syntax:
	bool	is_sorted(std::iterator begin, std::iterator end);
	bool	is_sorted(std::iterator begin, std::iterator end, order); order : std::greater<int>(), std::less<int>()

3|_partial_sor:
	partial_sort is function that takes a range of numbers and sorted, it can sort a part from all.
	
syntax:
	partial_sort(iterator begin, iterator rangEnd, iterator containerEnd);


4|_nth_element:


5|_is_sorted_until:
	finds how many elements are sorted in given range.

	syntax:
		iterartor is_sorted_until(iterator begin, iterator oend);
		iterartor is_sorted_until(iterator begin, iterator oend, order);

		return iterator to the last one sorted.

There is a function that distance(iterator start, iterator end);

6|_ std::iota
	fills the range start, end with sequentially values, starting from value to ++value;

	iota(iterator begin, iterator end, int startingValue);












ADD:
	missing 'typename" prior to dependent type name x = std::deque<type::iterator'
	add typename before x will solve the problem but how ?
